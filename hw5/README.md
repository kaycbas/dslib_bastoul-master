There a couple temperamental aspects of the bool calculator program that I ran out of time fixing...
	1) the program only works for a correctly formatted variable assignment file
	2) the program only works for correctly formatted equations (no error feature right now)
	3) variable names can't be 9 or more digits (as in the example) due to my use of atoi()
	4) the program messes up when there are multiple '~' in a row

Conclusion: It works properly for completely correct inputs but has little to no error safeguards right now
